      <h3>Zahid Hussain</h3>

      <p> Hi my name's Zahid and I am an enthuasistic programmer that loves to understand 
	  how technology works and the behind the scenes of my favourite classic games.
	  Before the bootcamp I previously did coding on python which was back in secondary
	  school and wanted to pursue it further. Once I finish University I am hoping to work
	  at an investment bank as this has been the job that I am most passionate about. </p>

    <h3>Bootcamp 2020: Sunset Animation</h3>

    <p>

	My first programming project, concluding the 2 week Programming Bootcamp at 
	City (2020). I made an animation of a sun setting and rising with a video of
	a food tech class I took part in sixth form where I was the camera man. With
	this idea in place I thought the setting was a bit dull so I wanted it to seem
	like you was in a drive in cinema where cars park up to watch a movie on the big
	screen</p>
